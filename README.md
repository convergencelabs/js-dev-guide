## Tools and Frameworks
To develop and build this repository the following tools are needed:

  * [mkdocs-material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) >= 7.1.x
  * Docker => 0.20.x

The developers primary work on MacOS / Linux so most scripts and instructions assume a Linux / Unix like build environment.

## Development
The developers prefer a docker based workflow.  First, obtain the docker image for mkdocs-material:

```shell
docker pull squidfunk/mkdocs-material
```

To serve the project live issue the following command from the root of the repository:

```shell
docker run \
  --rm \
  -it \
  -p 7000:7000 \
  -v ${PWD}:/docs \
  squidfunk/mkdocs-material serve --dev-addr 0.0.0.0:7000
```

Then visit: http://localhost:7000/

## static Build
To build the static content for the site issue the following command:

```shell
docker run --rm -it -v ${PWD}:/docs squidfunk/mkdocs-material build
```

This will create the `site` directory in the root of the project.  This directory is in the `.gitignore` file so that it won't be accidentally checked in.
